            <h2>Challenges as an International Student in the US</h2>
            <p>Being an international student can be difficult. Adapting to a different culture and a new country are some of the biggest challenges students face. This unique experience involves meeting new people, learning a new language, get used to a different way of life, and most importantly get used to being on your own</p>

            <p>It can be challenging for international students to make new friends during the first weeks of school. English is the main reason for some students; having a conversation using your second language can be challenging, mainly when your fellow students use words youâ€™ve never heard before. Slang can be tricky to understand during the first days of school. The fear of not communicating precisely what you are trying to say or being judged by other people for your accent or language barriers are some of the fears and challenges international students face. Seeing people of your age having different values, talking about stuff you never heard before, hearing other music, and American students sharing their childhood memories can make you feel that you come from an alien planet. Remembering your friends from your home country in contrast to the new people you are meeting in college is a significant change and can be very hard to get used to a new friend group.

                Social gatherings can be very different from where you come from, getting used to other music, finding ways to break the ice, introducing yourself in various ways, and getting used to the environment. What comes with it: alcohol, drugs, drunk people, could take time to get used to it. Personal values change; international students come with values from their home country and face a different value system when they arrive in the U.S. These changes impact how they relate with others and take time to adapt to different values. Meeting new people is one of the most challenging things international students face when they arrive at college.</p>
